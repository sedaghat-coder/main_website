**Layout**: Two-column (Image left, Text right)

**Content**:
> Hassan Sedaghat Baghbani is a talented Iranian painter who has been passionate about art since his childhood. He studied design and visual arts at the prestigious Espehbadi School in Iran, where he learned from renowned professors such as Professor Espahbadi. He also explored the works of contemporary masters such as Vadoud Mo'azzen, Rahim Navessi, Katouzian, Mohseni, and other local artists.

> Hassan was especially inspired by the oil paintings of Master Khoshsefat, whom he had the honor of being his student for three years. He developed his own style and technique, blending realism and expressionism. He has participated in several solo and group exhibitions, but he considers himself a lifelong learner who strives to improve his art.

> Hassan is currently a member of the Mashhad Visual Arts Association and teaches private drawing and oil painting classes. He believes that art should not be exposed to the public until it reaches a certain level of maturity, but he also welcomes feedback and guidance from other artists and visitors. He hopes to share his vision and passion with the world through his paintings.
